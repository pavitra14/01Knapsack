> Includes Run time comparision in nanoseconds, microseconds and seconds along with 2 test cases

## Conclusion
Sometimes Recursion is more than enough as it can yield lesser run time(as seen in in1). But for more complex test cases(like in2), top down approach is the most optimized

## Run
```sh
# For first test case
cat in1 | ./main
#For second test case
cat in2 | ./main
```
